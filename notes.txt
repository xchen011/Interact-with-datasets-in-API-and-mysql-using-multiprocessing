The script is for interacting with two datasets in mysql table and API, and doing comparisons between these two datasets. The data in API was read one by one page. Multiprocessing was applied for speeding up the processes of reading data from API and querying intersections between two datasets.  The total processing time of 81.5 sec in the results.txt is for running this script with 4 cpu cores. It can be faster with more cpu cores. The file named results.csv contains the data for the users within the intersections.
